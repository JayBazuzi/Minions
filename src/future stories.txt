This is a list of things that I will do in a future MMF.

* string literals
* operators
* function calls (paren syntax - I might do a temporary thing with function calls using haskell's adjacency syntax, just so that I can get some interesting cases working top to bottom.)
* syntax errors
 * escaped tab at start of line
 * tab anywhere during a line
 * incorrect indentation level at beginning of any statement or block
 * missing colon on block header line
* report errors that are found.
* report multiple errors, along with partial parse. Aka, parse every statement you can, as much as you can, and report the errors for the rest.
